    "text": "I really appreciate you both taking this meeting, especially given how competitive the fundraising environment has become. Let me walk you through where we stand with our AI insurance POC and why I believe we're uniquely positioned to capture this market opportunity. Over the past three months, we've been working intensively with our pilot customers to refine our machine learning algorithms. The results have exceeded our expectations - we're now achieving 92% accuracy in automated claims assessment, which translates to massive cost savings for insurance companies. What's particularly exciting is that our solution addresses the $40 billion problem of claims fraud detection. Our AI can identify suspicious patterns and anomalies that human adjusters often miss, potentially saving insurers millions per year. We've also made significant progress on regulatory compliance, working closely with IRDAI to ensure our platform meets all necessary requirements for the Indian insurance market.",

    "text": "Let me share a perspective from our portfolio companies that have attempted similar international expansions. The insurance industry is deeply local - relationships, regulations, and business practices vary dramatically across markets. Simply translating your software isn't sufficient. You need local partnerships, regulatory expertise, and often significant customization for each market. This requires substantial capital and can dilute your focus from perfecting your solution in your home market. Have you considered a partnership strategy with established insurance software vendors who already have international presence? This might be a more capital-efficient way to scale globally while maintaining focus on your core technology development.",

    "text": "You're absolutely right about the competitive landscape, and I've been thinking about this extensively. Our sustainable competitive advantage comes from three key areas: first, our deep integration with Indian regulatory requirements - we've spent 18 months working directly with IRDAI officials to ensure our AI models comply with local insurance regulations. Second, our data advantage - we've processed over 2.5 million historical claims from our pilot partners, which gives us training data that competitors simply don't have access to. Third, our technical architecture is genuinely differentiated - we're using a novel approach that combines transformer-based NLP models with computer vision for document analysis, wrapped in an ensemble framework that continuously learns from human feedback. It would take a competitor at least 12-18 months to replicate this technical stack, assuming they could access similar training data.",

    "text": "Arjun, from a global perspective, I'm seeing similar AI-driven insurance solutions across multiple markets, and the question is whether your approach can scale beyond India. The technology you've developed appears sophisticated, but I need to understand your international expansion strategy. How adaptable is your platform to different regulatory environments? Insurance regulations vary significantly across countries, and what works in India might not work in Southeast Asia or other emerging markets. Additionally, I'm curious about your data strategy. Insurance is fundamentally about risk assessment, and the quality of your AI depends entirely on the data you train it on. Do you have access to sufficient historical claims data to ensure your models are robust? How do you handle data privacy and cross-border data transfer requirements?",

    "text": "I appreciate those concerns, and let me address them directly with some specific data points. Our customer acquisition cost has actually been trending downward as we've refined our sales process - we're now at about $12,000 per enterprise customer, which compares favorably to the industry standard of $15-20K for B2B SaaS solutions in this space. The lifetime value calculation is admittedly complex in insurance because contracts tend to be multi-year with variable usage, but our pilot customers are processing an average of 1,200 claims per month through our platform, which translates to roughly $8,000 in monthly recurring revenue per customer. If we can maintain that usage level, we're looking at LTV of around $180,000 per customer over a three-year period. The challenge, as you've rightly identified, is scaling our sales efforts while maintaining these unit economics.",
