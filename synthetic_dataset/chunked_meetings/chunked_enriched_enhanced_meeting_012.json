    "text": "I know the past few months have been difficult for all of us, and I appreciate your patience as I've been navigating the challenges of fundraising and product development. I wanted to talk openly about where we stand as a family and as a business, because these two aspects of my life are becoming increasingly intertwined. The success of the company will ultimately determine our financial security and long-term opportunities, but I don't want to sacrifice our happiness and well-being in the pursuit of that success.",

What if the funding doesn't come through? What if the customers don't materialize the way you expect? You've invested two years of our lives and most of our savings into this venture, and while I admire your dedication, I'm scared about what happens if it doesn't work out. We're not 22 years old anymore - we need to think about our long-term financial security, starting a family, buying a home. I've been supportive of your entrepreneurial dreams, but I need to see some concrete milestones and timelines. How much longer are we going to live in this state of uncertainty? What specific goals need to be achieved for you to consider this venture successful?",

You've been working 16-hour days for the past six months, and it's affecting not just your health, but our relationship and our plans for the future. I know you believe in this opportunity, and I want to support you, but I'm worried about what we're sacrificing in the process. We had planned to start looking for a house this year, and we've put that on hold because of the uncertainty with the business. Our savings are dwindling because you're not taking a full salary, and I'm carrying the entire financial burden of our household expenses on my TCS income. When was the last time we had a proper conversation that wasn't about work or investors or funding? I feel like I'm losing my husband to this company.",

I know building a company is challenging, but I need to see that you're taking care of yourself and our relationship in the process. Can we establish some boundaries? Maybe no work calls after 9 PM, or at least one weekend day that's completely dedicated to us? I'm not asking you to abandon your dreams, but I need to feel like I'm still a priority in your life. Our marriage has to be stronger than your business, and right now, I'm not sure you see it that way.",
