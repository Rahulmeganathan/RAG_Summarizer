    "text": "I really appreciate you both taking this meeting, especially given how competitive the fundraising environment has become. Let me walk you through where we stand with our AI insurance POC and why I believe we're uniquely positioned to capture this market opportunity. Over the past three months, we've been working intensively with our pilot customers to refine our machine learning algorithms. The results have exceeded our expectations - we're now achieving 94% accuracy in automated claims assessment, which translates to massive cost savings for insurance companies. What's particularly exciting is that our solution addresses the $40 billion problem of claims fraud detection. Our AI can identify suspicious patterns and anomalies that human adjusters often miss, potentially saving insurers millions per year. We've also made significant progress on regulatory compliance, working closely with IRDAI to ensure our platform meets all necessary requirements for the Indian insurance market.",

    "text": "Arjun, I've been through this journey myself with multiple startups, and I can see you're facing the classic challenges that every B2B SaaS company encounters when trying to scale. The technology you've built is solid, but the real question is execution. I've seen brilliant technical teams struggle because they underestimated the complexity of enterprise sales, especially in a conservative industry like insurance. Your pilot results are encouraging, but how long did it take to close those deals? What was the decision-making process like? Insurance companies typically have 6-12 month sales cycles, and they'll want extensive proof of concept, security audits, and integration testing. Do you have the resources and patience to manage these lengthy sales processes while maintaining your burn rate?",

What I'd like to see is a broader platform strategy - can you expand beyond claims processing into underwriting, fraud detection, or customer service?

    "text": "I appreciate those concerns, and let me address them directly with some specific data points. Our customer acquisition cost has actually been trending downward as we've refined our sales process - we're now at about $12,000 per enterprise customer, which compares favorably to the industry standard of $15-20K for B2B SaaS solutions in this space. The lifetime value calculation is admittedly complex in insurance because contracts tend to be multi-year with variable usage, but our pilot customers are processing an average of 1,200 claims per month through our platform, which translates to roughly $8,000 in monthly recurring revenue per customer. If we can maintain that usage level, we're looking at LTV of around $180,000 per customer over a three-year period. The challenge, as you've rightly identified, is scaling our sales efforts while maintaining these unit economics.",
