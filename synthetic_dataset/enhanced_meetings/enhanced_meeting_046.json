You deserve to understand exactly what we're working toward and why I believe it's worth the sacrifice we're all making. The AI insurance market in India is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2027, and we have a genuine first-mover advantage. Our technology can reduce claims processing costs by 60% while improving customer satisfaction scores. We've already proven this with our pilot customers, and now it's about scaling and securing the capital we need to expand rapidly before competitors catch up."

      "text": "Arjun, I appreciate you taking the time to explain what's happening with the business, but I need you to understand the impact this is having on our family. You've been working 16-hour days for the past six months, and it's affecting not just your health, but our relationship and our plans for the future. I know you believe in this opportunity, and I want to support you, but I'm worried about what we're sacrificing in the process. We had planned to start looking for a house this year, and we've put that on hold because of the uncertainty with the business. Our savings are dwindling because you're not taking a full salary, and I'm carrying the entire financial burden of our household expenses on my TCS income. When was the last time we had a proper conversation that wasn't about work or investors or funding? I feel like I'm losing my husband to this company."

While I admire your confidence in this business venture, I think it's important to have realistic expectations and backup plans. Life has a way of surprising us, and the most successful people are those who can adapt to changing circumstances. I'm not asking you to give up on your dreams, but I want you to be smart about managing risk. Can you pursue this opportunity while also maintaining some financial security? Perhaps you could consult or work part-time while building your business? There's wisdom in taking calculated risks rather than betting everything on a single outcome."

      "text": "I know the financial uncertainty is scary, and I take full responsibility for putting us in this position. Let me share exactly where we stand: we have enough savings to cover our personal expenses for four more months if I continue taking no salary from the company. The business has enough funding to operate for six months at current burn rates. If we close the contracts I mentioned, I can start taking a $8,000 monthly salary starting in January, which covers most of our household expenses. If we secure the Series A funding we're pursuing, I can normalize my salary and we can get back on track with our original plans - buying a house, starting a family, building the life we've always talked about. I understand that these are all 'ifs,' but they're realistic possibilities based on concrete opportunities we're actively pursuing."

      "text": "The stress you're under is visible, Arjun, and it's affecting every aspect of our lives. You barely sleep, you're constantly on your phone during dinner, and when you do talk about work, it's always about problems - investors who are difficult, customers who are slow to decide, team members who aren't performing. I know building a company is challenging, but I need to see that you're taking care of yourself and our relationship in the process. Can we establish some boundaries? Maybe no work calls after 9 PM, or at least one weekend day that's completely dedicated to us? I'm not asking you to abandon your dreams, but I need to feel like I'm still a priority in your life. Our marriage has to be stronger than your business, and right now, I'm not sure you see it that way."

      "speaker": "Arjun Vasanth",
      "text": "You're right that I haven't been taking care of myself, and that's affecting all of us. I've been operating in constant crisis mode, reacting to whatever urgent issue comes up each day rather than taking a strategic approach to building the business and maintaining our relationship. Starting this week, I want to establish some non-negotiable boundaries: no work calls after 9 PM, no laptop use during family dinners, and at least one full day each weekend that's completely dedicated to us. I also think we should start seeing a counselor together - not because our marriage is in crisis, but because I want to make sure we're communicating effectively during this stressful period. Building a company shouldn't come at the expense of building our life together."

You've lost weight, you have dark circles under your eyes, and you seem to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. I know you want to achieve great things, and I'm proud of your intelligence and dedication, but I'm worried about what this pressure is doing to your body and mind. When was the last time you had a proper meal or a full night's sleep? You used to love cooking with me and watching movies on Sunday afternoons. Now, even when you're physically present, your mind is always somewhere else, thinking about work problems. I've raised you to be ambitious, but not at the cost of your health and happiness."
