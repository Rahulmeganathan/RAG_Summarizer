      "text": "I understand that my work schedule has been putting a strain on our family, and I don't want you to think that I'm prioritizing the business over our relationships. But I need you to understand the magnitude of the opportunity we're facing and why I believe this period of intense focus will ultimately benefit all of us. We're building something that could genuinely change the insurance industry in India. Every major insurance company struggles with claims processing - it's slow, expensive, and prone to errors. Our AI solution can automate 70% of that work while actually improving accuracy. If we can prove this at scale and secure the right funding, we're looking at a potential exit valuation of $100-200 million within the next three years. That would set up our family financially for life."

      "text": "The stress you're under is visible, Arjun, and it's affecting every aspect of our lives. You barely sleep, you're constantly on your phone during dinner, and when you do talk about work, it's always about problems - investors who are difficult, customers who are slow to decide, team members who aren't performing. I know building a company is challenging, but I need to see that you're taking care of yourself and our relationship in the process. Can we establish some boundaries? Maybe no work calls after 9 PM, or at least one weekend day that's completely dedicated to us? I'm not asking you to abandon your dreams, but I need to feel like I'm still a priority in your life. Our marriage has to be stronger than your business, and right now, I'm not sure you see it that way."

      "text": "I'm also worried about the toll this is taking on your health and your marriage. Meera is a wonderful girl, and she's been incredibly supportive of your ambitions, but I can see the strain in her eyes. You're asking a lot of her - to support the household financially while you pursue this uncertain venture, to accept a lifestyle of constant stress and uncertainty, to put her own dreams and plans on hold. That's not fair to her, and it's not sustainable for your marriage. Success in business means nothing if you lose your family in the process. I think you need to set some clear deadlines and exit criteria. If certain milestones aren't met by specific dates, you should consider returning to a more traditional career path."

You've lost weight, you have dark circles under your eyes, and you seem to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. I know you want to achieve great things, and I'm proud of your intelligence and dedication, but I'm worried about what this pressure is doing to your body and mind. When was the last time you had a proper meal or a full night's sleep? You used to love cooking with me and watching movies on Sunday afternoons. Now, even when you're physically present, your mind is always somewhere else, thinking about work problems. I've raised you to be ambitious, but not at the cost of your health and happiness."

      "text": "I know the financial uncertainty is scary, and I take full responsibility for putting us in this position. Let me share exactly where we stand: we have enough savings to cover our personal expenses for four more months if I continue taking no salary from the company. The business has enough funding to operate for six months at current burn rates. If we close the contracts I mentioned, I can start taking a $8,000 monthly salary starting in January, which covers most of our household expenses. If we secure the Series A funding we're pursuing, I can normalize my salary and we can get back on track with our original plans - buying a house, starting a family, building the life we've always talked about. I understand that these are all 'ifs,' but they're realistic possibilities based on concrete opportunities we're actively pursuing."

      "text": "I understand that the technology sector offers opportunities that didn't exist in my generation, but I also understand business fundamentals that haven't changed. You need customers who are willing to pay, you need predictable revenue, and you need to manage your expenses carefully. From what you've told us, you have pilot customers but no guaranteed revenue, you're burning through savings, and you're dependent on investors who may or may not provide funding. This sounds incredibly risky to me. In banking, we had a saying: 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.' Right now, you've put everything - your time, money, career, and family's well-being - into this single venture. What's your contingency plan?"

The truth is, I've been so consumed by the daily crises - investor calls, customer issues, technical problems - that I've lost sight of what really matters. But I need you to understand that we're genuinely close to a breakthrough. Two of our pilot customers are ready to sign annual contracts worth $150,000 each, and we have three more in advanced negotiations. If we can close these deals over the next 60 days, it changes everything - our recurring revenue will be sufficient to support both the business and our family's needs. I'm not asking for unlimited patience, but I am asking for 90 more days to prove that this can work. If we don't hit these milestones by the end of next quarter, I promise I'll seriously consider returning to a traditional career path."

      "text": "Son, I've been watching you for the past year, and while I admire your technical skills and your ambition, I'm concerned about the path you've chosen. In my 35 years in banking, I learned that financial security comes from steady, predictable income and careful risk management. What you're doing is essentially gambling with your future and our family's stability. Yes, there's potential for significant returns, but there's also a very real possibility of losing everything. Have you considered what happens if this venture fails? You're 29 years old - these are crucial years for building your career and financial foundation. If you spend another two years on this startup and it doesn't succeed, you'll be 31 with a gap in your traditional work experience. How easy will it be to find a good job then?"
