      "text": "I've been thinking a lot about our conversation last week, and I realize I haven't been doing a good job of balancing my commitment to the business with my responsibilities to our family. The pressure from investors and the demands of building this company have been consuming me, but I don't want that to come at the expense of our relationship or my health. At the same time, I truly believe we're on the verge of something extraordinary with this AI insurance platform, and I'm struggling with how to manage both priorities effectively."

      "text": "Arjun, I appreciate you taking the time to explain what's happening with the business, but I need you to understand the impact this is having on our family. You've been working 16-hour days for the past six months, and it's affecting not just your health, but our relationship and our plans for the future. I know you believe in this opportunity, and I want to support you, but I'm worried about what we're sacrificing in the process. We had planned to start looking for a house this year, and we've put that on hold because of the uncertainty with the business. Our savings are dwindling because you're not taking a full salary, and I'm carrying the entire financial burden of our household expenses on my TCS income. When was the last time we had a proper conversation that wasn't about work or investors or funding? I feel like I'm losing my husband to this company."

      "text": "I've been struggling with this balance between pursuing an opportunity that could transform our lives and maintaining the stability and happiness that you deserve right now. The business reality is that we're at a critical juncture - the next three months will largely determine whether this venture succeeds or fails. But the personal reality is that I can't achieve business success at the expense of losing the most important relationships in my life. I think the solution has to involve better boundaries and more realistic expectations. Instead of working seven days a week, I need to protect our time together and trust that focused, strategic work will be more effective than exhausted, round-the-clock grinding."

What if the funding doesn't come through? What if the customers don't materialize the way you expect? You've invested two years of our lives and most of our savings into this venture, and while I admire your dedication, I'm scared about what happens if it doesn't work out. We're not 22 years old anymore - we need to think about our long-term financial security, starting a family, buying a home. I've been supportive of your entrepreneurial dreams, but I need to see some concrete milestones and timelines. How much longer are we going to live in this state of uncertainty? What specific goals need to be achieved for you to consider this venture successful?"

      "text": "What I've learned over these past months is that sustainable success requires sustainable practices. I can't build a company that lasts if I burn out in the process, and I can't build wealth that matters if I lose my family while pursuing it. I want to propose a modified approach: I'll commit to specific work hours and family hours, I'll be more transparent about business milestones and timelines, and I'll actively involve you in major decisions that affect our future. This company should enhance our life together, not replace it. If I can't figure out how to build the business while maintaining our relationship, then I'm not as smart as I think I am."

      "text": "The stress you're under is visible, Arjun, and it's affecting every aspect of our lives. You barely sleep, you're constantly on your phone during dinner, and when you do talk about work, it's always about problems - investors who are difficult, customers who are slow to decide, team members who aren't performing. I know building a company is challenging, but I need to see that you're taking care of yourself and our relationship in the process. Can we establish some boundaries? Maybe no work calls after 9 PM, or at least one weekend day that's completely dedicated to us? I'm not asking you to abandon your dreams, but I need to feel like I'm still a priority in your life. Our marriage has to be stronger than your business, and right now, I'm not sure you see it that way."
