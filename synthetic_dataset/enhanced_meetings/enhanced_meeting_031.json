But I need you to understand the magnitude of the opportunity we're facing and why I believe this period of intense focus will ultimately benefit all of us. We're building something that could genuinely change the insurance industry in India. Every major insurance company struggles with claims processing - it's slow, expensive, and prone to errors. Our AI solution can automate 70% of that work while actually improving accuracy. If we can prove this at scale and secure the right funding, we're looking at a potential exit valuation of $100-200 million within the next three years. That would set up our family financially for life."

She's managing all the household responsibilities while also working full-time to support both of you financially. That's a lot of pressure for a young woman. I watch her making excuses for your absence at family gatherings, explaining to relatives why you can't attend weddings or festivals. She's sacrificing her own social life and happiness to support your dreams. I hope you appreciate what a treasure she is and that you're not taking her support for granted. Marriage is a partnership, beta, and partnerships require balance and mutual consideration."

      "text": "I understand that the technology sector offers opportunities that didn't exist in my generation, but I also understand business fundamentals that haven't changed. You need customers who are willing to pay, you need predictable revenue, and you need to manage your expenses carefully. From what you've told us, you have pilot customers but no guaranteed revenue, you're burning through savings, and you're dependent on investors who may or may not provide funding. This sounds incredibly risky to me. In banking, we had a saying: 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.' Right now, you've put everything - your time, money, career, and family's well-being - into this single venture. What's your contingency plan?"

      "text": "Arjun, I appreciate you taking the time to explain what's happening with the business, but I need you to understand the impact this is having on our family. You've been working 16-hour days for the past six months, and it's affecting not just your health, but our relationship and our plans for the future. I know you believe in this opportunity, and I want to support you, but I'm worried about what we're sacrificing in the process. We had planned to start looking for a house this year, and we've put that on hold because of the uncertainty with the business. Our savings are dwindling because you're not taking a full salary, and I'm carrying the entire financial burden of our household expenses on my TCS income. When was the last time we had a proper conversation that wasn't about work or investors or funding? I feel like I'm losing my husband to this company."

      "speaker": "Arjun Vasanth",
      "text": "I know the financial uncertainty is scary, and I take full responsibility for putting us in this position. Let me share exactly where we stand: we have enough savings to cover our personal expenses for four more months if I continue taking no salary from the company. The business has enough funding to operate for six months at current burn rates. If we close the contracts I mentioned, I can start taking a $8,000 monthly salary starting in January, which covers most of our household expenses. If we secure the Series A funding we're pursuing, I can normalize my salary and we can get back on track with our original plans - buying a house, starting a family, building the life we've always talked about. I understand that these are all 'ifs,' but they're realistic possibilities based on concrete opportunities we're actively pursuing."

The truth is, I've been so consumed by the daily crises - investor calls, customer issues, technical problems - that I've lost sight of what really matters. But I need you to understand that we're genuinely close to a breakthrough. Two of our pilot customers are ready to sign annual contracts worth $150,000 each, and we have three more in advanced negotiations. If we can close these deals over the next 60 days, it changes everything - our recurring revenue will be sufficient to support both the business and our family's needs. I'm not asking for unlimited patience, but I am asking for 90 more days to prove that this can work. If we don't hit these milestones by the end of next quarter, I promise I'll seriously consider returning to a traditional career path."

      "text": "I'm also worried about the toll this is taking on your health and your marriage. Meera is a wonderful girl, and she's been incredibly supportive of your ambitions, but I can see the strain in her eyes. You're asking a lot of her - to support the household financially while you pursue this uncertain venture, to accept a lifestyle of constant stress and uncertainty, to put her own dreams and plans on hold. That's not fair to her, and it's not sustainable for your marriage. Success in business means nothing if you lose your family in the process. I think you need to set some clear deadlines and exit criteria. If certain milestones aren't met by specific dates, you should consider returning to a more traditional career path."

You've lost weight, you have dark circles under your eyes, and you seem to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. I know you want to achieve great things, and I'm proud of your intelligence and dedication, but I'm worried about what this pressure is doing to your body and mind. When was the last time you had a proper meal or a full night's sleep? You used to love cooking with me and watching movies on Sunday afternoons. Now, even when you're physically present, your mind is always somewhere else, thinking about work problems. I've raised you to be ambitious, but not at the cost of your health and happiness."
