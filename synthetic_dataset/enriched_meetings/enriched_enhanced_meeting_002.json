The pressure from investors and the demands of building this company have been consuming me, but I don't want that to come at the expense of our relationship or my health. At the same time, I truly believe we're on the verge of something extraordinary with this AI insurance platform, and I'm struggling with how to manage both priorities effectively."

They want evidence that you can acquire customers systematically and retain them successfully. What's your monthly recurring revenue growth rate? What's your customer retention rate? How much are customers expanding their usage over time? These metrics matter more than your technology's accuracy or your total addressable market size. Focus on creating a compelling growth story with clear milestones and predictable patterns. Also, consider whether you're ready for the operational complexity that comes with scaling. Do you have the infrastructure, processes, and team to support 10x more customers? Scaling too fast without proper foundations can kill a promising company."

Our sustainable competitive advantage comes from three key areas: first, our deep integration with Indian regulatory requirements - we've spent 18 months working directly with IRDAI officials to ensure our AI models comply with local insurance regulations. Second, our data advantage - we've processed over 2.5 million historical claims from our pilot partners, which gives us training data that competitors simply don't have access to. Third, our technical architecture is genuinely differentiated - we're using a novel approach that combines transformer-based NLP models with computer vision for document analysis, wrapped in an ensemble framework that continuously learns from human feedback. It would take a competitor at least 12-18 months to replicate this technical stack, assuming they could access similar training data."

The technology you've built is impressive, but the real challenge now is building a repeatable, scalable sales process. In B2B SaaS, especially in enterprise sales, product-market fit isn't just about having a working product - it's about having a product that customers will buy predictably and repeatedly. I've seen brilliant technical teams fail because they couldn't crack the sales puzzle. You need to focus intensively on understanding your customer's buying process. Who are the decision makers? What's their budget cycle? What ROI metrics do they use to justify technology investments? Map out your entire sales funnel and identify where prospects are dropping off."

      "text": "Let me walk you through our regulatory strategy in detail, because I think this is actually one of our strongest moats. We've been working closely with IRDAI for the past year, and we have preliminary approval for our AI models under their current guidelines for automated claims processing. More importantly, we've been participating in their working group on AI governance in insurance, which means we have early insight into upcoming regulatory changes. Our compliance framework includes full audit trails for every AI decision, explainability features that allow human adjusters to understand why our algorithm reached specific conclusions, and fail-safes that escalate complex cases to human review. We're not just compliant with current regulations - we're helping to shape future regulatory frameworks for AI in insurance."
