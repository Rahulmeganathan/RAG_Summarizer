But I need you to understand the magnitude of the opportunity we're facing and why I believe this period of intense focus will ultimately benefit all of us. We're building something that could genuinely change the insurance industry in India. Every major insurance company struggles with claims processing - it's slow, expensive, and prone to errors. Our AI solution can automate 70% of that work while actually improving accuracy. If we can prove this at scale and secure the right funding, we're looking at a potential exit valuation of $100-200 million within the next three years. That would set up our family financially for life."

While I admire your confidence in this business venture, I think it's important to have realistic expectations and backup plans. Life has a way of surprising us, and the most successful people are those who can adapt to changing circumstances. I'm not asking you to give up on your dreams, but I want you to be smart about managing risk. Can you pursue this opportunity while also maintaining some financial security? Perhaps you could consult or work part-time while building your business? There's wisdom in taking calculated risks rather than betting everything on a single outcome."

      "text": "Son, I've been watching you for the past year, and while I admire your technical skills and your ambition, I'm concerned about the path you've chosen. In my 35 years in banking, I learned that financial security comes from steady, predictable income and careful risk management. What you're doing is essentially gambling with your future and our family's stability. Yes, there's potential for significant returns, but there's also a very real possibility of losing everything. Have you considered what happens if this venture fails? You're 29 years old - these are crucial years for building your career and financial foundation. If you spend another two years on this startup and it doesn't succeed, you'll be 31 with a gap in your traditional work experience. How easy will it be to find a good job then?"

The truth is, I've been so consumed by the daily crises - investor calls, customer issues, technical problems - that I've lost sight of what really matters. But I need you to understand that we're genuinely close to a breakthrough. Two of our pilot customers are ready to sign annual contracts worth $150,000 each, and we have three more in advanced negotiations. If we can close these deals over the next 60 days, it changes everything - our recurring revenue will be sufficient to support both the business and our family's needs. I'm not asking for unlimited patience, but I am asking for 90 more days to prove that this can work. If we don't hit these milestones by the end of next quarter, I promise I'll seriously consider returning to a traditional career path."

      "text": "I understand that the technology sector offers opportunities that didn't exist in my generation, but I also understand business fundamentals that haven't changed. You need customers who are willing to pay, you need predictable revenue, and you need to manage your expenses carefully. From what you've told us, you have pilot customers but no guaranteed revenue, you're burning through savings, and you're dependent on investors who may or may not provide funding. This sounds incredibly risky to me. In banking, we had a saying: 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.' Right now, you've put everything - your time, money, career, and family's well-being - into this single venture. What's your contingency plan?"

She's managing all the household responsibilities while also working full-time to support both of you financially. That's a lot of pressure for a young woman. I watch her making excuses for your absence at family gatherings, explaining to relatives why you can't attend weddings or festivals. She's sacrificing her own social life and happiness to support your dreams. I hope you appreciate what a treasure she is and that you're not taking her support for granted. Marriage is a partnership, beta, and partnerships require balance and mutual consideration."

Meera is a wonderful girl, and she's been incredibly supportive of your ambitions, but I can see the strain in her eyes. You're asking a lot of her - to support the household financially while you pursue this uncertain venture, to accept a lifestyle of constant stress and uncertainty, to put her own dreams and plans on hold. That's not fair to her, and it's not sustainable for your marriage. Success in business means nothing if you lose your family in the process. I think you need to set some clear deadlines and exit criteria. If certain milestones aren't met by specific dates, you should consider returning to a more traditional career path."
