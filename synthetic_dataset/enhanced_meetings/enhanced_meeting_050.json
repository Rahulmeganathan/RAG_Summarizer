      "text": "Thank you both for making time in your busy schedules to meet with us today. I'm really excited to share the progress we've made on our AI insurance platform over the past quarter. Our machine learning model has achieved 95% accuracy in automated claims processing, which is significantly higher than the industry standard of around 85%. We're processing real insurance claims data from three pilot customers, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The key breakthrough came when we solved the challenge of handling unstructured documents - medical reports, police reports, and damage assessments - which traditionally required manual review. Our NLP pipeline can now extract relevant information with remarkable precision, reducing processing time from weeks to just 2-3 days. I believe we're at an inflection point where we can demonstrate clear ROI to insurance companies and start scaling our operations."

      "text": "The unit economics you've presented need more scrutiny, particularly if you're planning to expand internationally. Customer acquisition costs tend to increase significantly when you're entering new markets where you don't have established relationships or brand recognition. How do you plan to adapt your go-to-market strategy for different cultural and business environments? I'm also concerned about your technology infrastructure. Can your platform handle the scale and complexity of processing claims in multiple languages and currencies? What about integration with different core insurance systems that vary by country? These technical challenges often prove more costly and time-consuming than founders anticipate."

      "text": "I appreciate those concerns, and let me address them directly with some specific data points. Our customer acquisition cost has actually been trending downward as we've refined our sales process - we're now at about $12,000 per enterprise customer, which compares favorably to the industry standard of $15-20K for B2B SaaS solutions in this space. The lifetime value calculation is admittedly complex in insurance because contracts tend to be multi-year with variable usage, but our pilot customers are processing an average of 1,200 claims per month through our platform, which translates to roughly $8,000 in monthly recurring revenue per customer. If we can maintain that usage level, we're looking at LTV of around $180,000 per customer over a three-year period. The challenge, as you've rightly identified, is scaling our sales efforts while maintaining these unit economics."

      "text": "Let me share a perspective from our portfolio companies that have attempted similar international expansions. The insurance industry is deeply local - relationships, regulations, and business practices vary dramatically across markets. Simply translating your software isn't sufficient. You need local partnerships, regulatory expertise, and often significant customization for each market. This requires substantial capital and can dilute your focus from perfecting your solution in your home market. Have you considered a partnership strategy with established insurance software vendors who already have international presence? This might be a more capital-efficient way to scale globally while maintaining focus on your core technology development."

      "text": "Arjun, from a global perspective, I'm seeing similar AI-driven insurance solutions across multiple markets, and the question is whether your approach can scale beyond India. The technology you've developed appears sophisticated, but I need to understand your international expansion strategy. How adaptable is your platform to different regulatory environments? Insurance regulations vary significantly across countries, and what works in India might not work in Southeast Asia or other emerging markets. Additionally, I'm curious about your data strategy. Insurance is fundamentally about risk assessment, and the quality of your AI depends entirely on the data you train it on. Do you have access to sufficient historical claims data to ensure your models are robust? How do you handle data privacy and cross-border data transfer requirements?"

      "text": "Let me walk you through our regulatory strategy in detail, because I think this is actually one of our strongest moats. We've been working closely with IRDAI for the past year, and we have preliminary approval for our AI models under their current guidelines for automated claims processing. More importantly, we've been participating in their working group on AI governance in insurance, which means we have early insight into upcoming regulatory changes. Our compliance framework includes full audit trails for every AI decision, explainability features that allow human adjusters to understand why our algorithm reached specific conclusions, and fail-safes that escalate complex cases to human review. We're not just compliant with current regulations - we're helping to shape future regulatory frameworks for AI in insurance."
