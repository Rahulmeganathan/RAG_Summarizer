      "text": "I've been thinking a lot about our conversation last week, and I realize I haven't been doing a good job of balancing my commitment to the business with my responsibilities to our family. The pressure from investors and the demands of building this company have been consuming me, but I don't want that to come at the expense of our relationship or my health. At the same time, I truly believe we're on the verge of something extraordinary with this AI insurance platform, and I'm struggling with how to manage both priorities effectively."

      "text": "I understand that you're passionate about this technology and the potential impact it could have, but I need to know that you have a realistic backup plan. What if the funding doesn't come through? What if the customers don't materialize the way you expect? You've invested two years of our lives and most of our savings into this venture, and while I admire your dedication, I'm scared about what happens if it doesn't work out. We're not 22 years old anymore - we need to think about our long-term financial security, starting a family, buying a home. I've been supportive of your entrepreneurial dreams, but I need to see some concrete milestones and timelines. How much longer are we going to live in this state of uncertainty? What specific goals need to be achieved for you to consider this venture successful?"

In my 35 years in banking, I learned that financial security comes from steady, predictable income and careful risk management. What you're doing is essentially gambling with your future and our family's stability. Yes, there's potential for significant returns, but there's also a very real possibility of losing everything. Have you considered what happens if this venture fails? You're 29 years old - these are crucial years for building your career and financial foundation. If you spend another two years on this startup and it doesn't succeed, you'll be 31 with a gap in your traditional work experience. How easy will it be to find a good job then?"

The business reality is that we're at a critical juncture - the next three months will largely determine whether this venture succeeds or fails. But the personal reality is that I can't achieve business success at the expense of losing the most important relationships in my life. I think the solution has to involve better boundaries and more realistic expectations. Instead of working seven days a week, I need to protect our time together and trust that focused, strategic work will be more effective than exhausted, round-the-clock grinding."

      "text": "I'm also worried about the toll this is taking on your health and your marriage. Meera is a wonderful girl, and she's been incredibly supportive of your ambitions, but I can see the strain in her eyes. You're asking a lot of her - to support the household financially while you pursue this uncertain venture, to accept a lifestyle of constant stress and uncertainty, to put her own dreams and plans on hold. That's not fair to her, and it's not sustainable for your marriage. Success in business means nothing if you lose your family in the process. I think you need to set some clear deadlines and exit criteria. If certain milestones aren't met by specific dates, you should consider returning to a more traditional career path."

You need customers who are willing to pay, you need predictable revenue, and you need to manage your expenses carefully. From what you've told us, you have pilot customers but no guaranteed revenue, you're burning through savings, and you're dependent on investors who may or may not provide funding. This sounds incredibly risky to me. In banking, we had a saying: 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.' Right now, you've put everything - your time, money, career, and family's well-being - into this single venture. What's your contingency plan?"
